The jQuery Foundation is governed by 2 branches which separate business and technical decisions. The Board of Directors leads the business branch and is composed of corporate member representatives as well as a representative from the Collaboration Board. The technical branch of governance handles all technical aspects of the Foundation, independent of the Board of Directors.

# Board of Directors

The Board of Directors (BoD) serves as the business guiding branch of governance and as such, they tackle tasks and decisions involving topics like marketing, legal, fundraising, and other business driving topics. They also define the strategic direction for the Foundation and set policies and procedures to enable the Foundation to work toward those strategic goals. The BoD also appoints officers who handle the administrative functions of the board such as scheduling and presiding over meetings (President), taking of minutes (Secretary), budgetary oversight (Treasurer) and other functions as necessary.

# Staff

The BoD also appoints an Executive Director (ED) to run the Foundation on a day-to-day basis. The ED is tasked with contributing to the strategic initiatives set out by the BoD, implementing those initiatives and then reporting back on their success. The ED has the authority, within the boundaries of the current budget, to hire staff and contractors or partner with other organizations to advance the Foundation toward its goals. The ED reports to the President of the BoD with additional oversight and input from the full BoD.

# Collaboration Board

The Collaboration Board (CB) creates and enforces the Foundation-wide policies and procedures that govern the technical side of the Foundation in accordance with the strategic goals and initiatives set out by the Board of Directors. Projects within the Foundation govern themselves in terms of technical decisions, setting roadmaps, release schedules, etc. Projects then elect representatives to be placed on a Technical Steering Committee (TSC) which will provide policy enforcement and conflict resolution for one or more Projects. Those TSCs then elect representatives to serve on the CB where they provide similar oversight at a Foundation-wide level, admit new Projects into and graduate them from the mentorship program, and provide mechanisms for collaboration among Projects across the Foundation. The CB also elects one of their members to represent the technical interests of the Foundation on the Board of Directors.
